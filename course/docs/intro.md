# Introduction

Welcome to your journey to developing a dApp on Zilliqa blockchain!

## What is this course about?
This TLDR dApp course is divided into **three chapters** to introduce developers to (1) essentials of Scilla, (2) how to use ZilliqaJS to interact with Zilliqa blockchain and finally, we are going to (3) create a dApp from everything. The course should take around 1-3 hours (_with the pre-requisites_). 

This TLDR dApp course **will NOT teach you the basics, everything and also in-depth details**! 

The aim of this course is to provide some directions when it comes to developing a dApp. Why? There are already tons of official documentations of Scilla, ZilliqaJS and Neo-Savant IDE. Rather than overloading new developers with documentations and links, we wish to let them understand how the relations between different tools work together. Through this method of learning, one can know what are the essentials to focus on and have a better sense of direction.

It is **recommended to follow the chapters in sequence** as each chapter would require knowledge from previous chapters. 

However, those who are confident or adventurous may skip to the final chapter.

## Pre-Requisites
